    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p>Albert Einstein was born in Germany on March 14 1879.  At a young age, Einstein was reaching a mathematical level years ahead of his peers.  When he was twelve, he discovered his own original proof of the Pythagorean theorum.  Not long after that he had already reached a level of mathematical genius that not many in his life could follow.  He started teaching himself calculus at age twelve, and by age fourteen he had mastered it.  At seventeen, he had already enrolled in a four-year mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Polytechnic.  It was during this period that Einstein met his future wife, Mileva Maric, who was also enrolled at the Polytechnic.</p>
    <h2>Scientific Career</h2>
    <p>Einstein published an incredible amount of content throughout his life.  He published more than 300 scientific papers, as well as another 150 non-scientific ones, along with hundreds of books and articles.  Einstein's intellectual achievements are such that his name has even become synonymous with "genius" itself.  In 1905 Einstein published the <em>Annus Mirabilis</em> papers, a four article series pertaining to the photoelectic effect, Brownian motion, the special theory of relativity, and E = mc<sup>2</sup>.  These works gave rise to the quantum theory, and contributed significantly to the foundation of modern physics and substantially influenced popular views on space, time, and matter.  From 1907 to 1915 Einstein was developing his theory of general relativity, which revolutionized the idea of gravitation, and has since become the foundation for the current understanding of black holes.  In 1916 Einstein went on to predict the existence of gravitational waves, which are ripples in the curvature of spacetime.  His prediction was first proven accurate in the 1970s, when observing a pair of closely orbiting neutron stars.  By 1917 Einstein was applying his general theory of relativity to the universe as a whole, forever changing the way we look at space, and paving the way for countless discoveries ever since.  Fast-forward to 1935, when Albert Einstein and Nathan Rosen first produced a model of a wormhole, which are now often called Einstein-Rosen bridges.  Following his research on general relativity, Einstein began work on his "unified field theory."  Einstein became very isolated in his research at this time, and his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.  Einstein's dream of unifying other laws of physics with gravity continues to motivate scientists to this day.  </p>
